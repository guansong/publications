\emph{Abstract:} 
{

The Cell processor has many advantages: computation power, memory bandwidth,
and power consumption. On the other ahdn, it is hard to program.  The two
distinct ISAs, limited SPU address space and explicit DMA communications, all
complicate the programming effort on this processor.  We are helping this
situation by providing an OpenMP compiler for Cell.  We can implement a full
OpenMP compliant compiler to run potentially any OpenMP programs on such a
processor with reasonable performance. In this paper, we introduce the runtime
support for the OpenMP compiler and show how to map major OpenMP constructs
onto a Cell processor. This paper will help programmers write Cell applications
using industry standard OpenMP, and help people with an OpenMP background use
the Cell processor more effectively.
