  In this paper, we are exploring the idea of improving the OpenMP 2.5 standard
  to facilitate parallel programming on emerging architectures. This includes
  mapping threads to particular processors, improving the load balance among
  processors by work distribution, and supporting nested parallelism inherited
  from applications. We will demonstrate the performance gains of thread
  mapping with our experimental implementation, and propose new concepts in the
  standard to try addressing the issue in a broader sense.
