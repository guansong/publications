\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we document the experimental work in our attempts to
  automatically parallelize SPEC2000FP benchmarks for SMP machines.
  This is not purely a research project. It was implemented
  within IBM's software laboratory in a commercial compiler
  infrastructure that implements OpenMP 2.0 specifications in both
  Fortran and C/C++. From the beginning, our emphasis is on using
  simple parallelization techniques. We aim to maintain a good trade-off between performance, especially scalability of an application
  program and its compilation time. Although the parallelization
  results show relatively low speed up, it is still promising
  considering the problems associated with explicit parallel programming and the fact that more and more multi-thread and multi-core
  chips will soon be available even for home computing.
