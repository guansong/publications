\begin{abstract}
  Barrier synchronization is an important and performance critical
  primitive in many parallel programming models, including the popular
  OpenMP model.  In this paper, we compare the performance of several
  software implementations of barrier synchronization and introduce a
  new implementation, \emph{distributed counters with local sensor},
  which considerably reduces overhead on POWER3 and POWER4 SMP
  systems.  Through experiments with the EPCC OpenMP benchmark, we
  demonstrate a 79\% reduction in overhead on a 32-way POWER4 system
  and an 87\% reduction in overhead on a 16-way POWER3 system when
  comparing with a fetch-and-add implementation.  Since these
  improvements are primarily attributed to reduced L2 and L3 cache
  misses, we expect the relative performance of our implementation to
  increase with the number of processors in an SMP and as memory
  latencies lengthen relative to cache latencies.
