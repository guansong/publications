\emph{Abstract:} { Although OpenMP has become the leading standard in
  parallel programming languages, the implementation of its runtime
  environment is not well discussed in the literature. In this paper,
  we introduce some of the key data structures required to implement
  OpenMP workshares in our runtime library and also discuss
  considerations on how to improve its performance.  This includes
  items such as how to set up a workshare control block queue, how to
  initialize the data within a control block, how to improve barrier
  performance and how to handle implicit barrier and nowait
  situations. Finally, we discuss the performance of this
  implementation focusing on the EPCC benchmark.}
